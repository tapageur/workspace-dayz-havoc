# Rules

## Be respectful

Simple enough, be respectful to other players. We all know the basic rules of netiquette and we are all adults, right?

## No free kill

We are a community that encourage players interactions and different degrees of collaboration.

## Languages

We want to be able to moderate (if needed) the communication in-game and over Discord to resolve possible issue and conflicts. For this reason the communications are accepted in french and english only.
