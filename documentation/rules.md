# Rules

## Be respectful

Simple enough, be respectful to other players. We all know the basic rules of netiquette and we are all adults, right?

## No player kill

Unless asked by a player, it's forbidden to kill another player.

> It was all fun and games until someone lost an eye...

If by accident you kill another player, you are responsible of:
* Taking care of the items the other player was carrying so they don't despawn and to ensure it's safe return to it's owner
* Help the player to travel safe to the location of its death, or any other location agreed on

## No stealing from other players

* If by any chance you find another player base or vehicules, respect their property
* If you need something another player has in its stash, please ask them if you can take it

## Don't share the server's password

To help us manage our community and who has the server's password, please let me know if you would like to invite a new player to our community. This will help me ensure all the player the right informations and maintain a list of people in case the server's password change.

## Languages

We want to be able to moderate (if needed) the communication in-game and over Discord to resolve possible issue and conflicts. For this reason the communications are accepted in french and english only.
