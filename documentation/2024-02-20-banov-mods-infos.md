### BetterStash

> The mod adds a Plastic Barrel which functions similarly to the barrels in the game already, however you can use a shovel bury it to turn it into a hidden stash, inspired by the hidden caches in Tarkov.

### CF

* `Community Framework` mod is required for a lot of mods and is required to be installed on a server fresh wipe. 
* It's required for the `DayZ Expansion` mods.

### Community-Online-Tools

This [link](https://pingperfect.com/index.php/knowledgebase/400/DayZ--How-To-Install-Community-Online-Tools-and-CF-Admin-Tools.html) helped me figured it out.

| Key binding | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Y`         | Open/close player's book |
| `H`         | This teleports you to the position you are looking at (Unbinded: Enter in conflict with `Ping location`) |
| `Insert`    | Toggle free camera Note: This teleports your player to the position you looked at when exiting out of it |
| `End`       | Toggles Community Online Tools keybindings on/off |

### DayZ-Bicycle

### DayZ-Expansion-Book

`DayZ Expansion Book` add into the game a virtual book which can be used by other mods to add more pages for various uses. It's required for the `DayZ Expansion Groups` mod.

|-------------|-------------|
| `B`         | Open/close player's book |

### DayZ-Expansion-Core

It's required for the `DayZ Expansion` mods installed in this server.

### DayZ-Expansion-Groups

Add the ability to create groups with your friends and it's used in combination with another mod, see `DayZ-Expansion-Navigation` for more details.

### DayZ-Expansion-Name-Tags

Allow players to see the name of another survivor.

### DayZ-Expansion-Navigation

Introduce to the game map markers, compass hud and a GPS. 

Used in combination with `DayZ-Expansion-Groups`, it allow players to:
* Create group markers
* Ping locations
* See each others location on the map and ingame

| Key binding | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `H`         | Ping location, group can see it |

| `M`         | Toggle on/off the map |
| `Delete`    | Remove the ping location |
| `*` (keypad)| Toggle on/off display in-game markers |

### Ear-Plugs

| Key binding | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `N`         | Toggle on/off the ear plugs |

### EvenMoreDoors

As you can see from the screenshots, these doors are vanilla-style, allowing for a more consistent look and feel for basebuilding, especially for those who don't run Expansion or BaseBuildingPlus. The doors themselves extend from the Fence class, and make use of the vanilla construction system, so no more "crate" type kits.

### FieldShovelPlus

> This mod brings back the vanilla Field Shovel with the addition of the "Dig out stash" action and now includes a new folding shovel!

### MuchStuffPack

Decoration items for the base building.

* All placed kits can be dismantled by Screwdriver, Pliers or Hammers

### ufcring

UFC Ring

### Survivor Animations

This mod is required for `DayZ-Bicycle` and it adds custom survivor animations (emotes/actions) including vehicles. Our goal is to provide the most wanted animations for characters and provide supporting animations for other mods like bikes, snowmobiles, helicopters, horses and more.
